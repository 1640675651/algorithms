bfs cannot keep track all possible paths.

# recursion and stack limit
import resource, sys
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_STACK, (2**29,-1)) # may not work
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6) # Will mostly cause stack overflow or TLE if need this many recursions

Convert binary string bs to int in Python: int(bs, 2)
Convert int to binary string: bin(x)

when processing very large numbers (e.g. 10^(10^5)), store lower digits in lower index for convenience.

Sometimes can convert things to intervals, sort the intervals by their upper bound and use greedy.

Don't try to modify things in a priority queue/heap. Just insert new entries, they will "mask off" the old ones, and remember to ignore the old ones.

Sometimes do a high-level counting may works... instead of diving too deep into the structural details. 

Use LONG LONG! Don't bother deciding which to use int and which to use long long when the numbers are large. Just use everything as LONG LONG.

Sometimes greedy is not just coming up with a single equation. Can do some brute-force if time complexity allows.

READ PROBLEMS CAREFULLY! 
	INPUT ON MULTIPLE LINES
	you DO NOT need to minimize k
