check whether a point p is in a polygon:

loop through the vertices of the polygon a1 ... an, in clockwise order.
if all angle (a1, p, a+1) are counterclockwise, the point is in the polygon.
To check whether the angles is counterclockwise, use the same cross product technique used in convex hull.
That is, (a1 p) x (p a2) > 0, the angle is counterclockwise.

Area or triangle: 0.5 * a * b sin(theta), where theta is the angle between side a and b
Area of regular n-gon: 0.5 * n * r * r * sin(2 * PI / n);

sum of angle of n-gon: (n-2) * PI

Converting Cartesian to polar
The value of tan-1( y/x ) may need to be adjusted:
Quadrant I: Use the calculator value
Quadrant II: Add 180°
Quadrant III: Add 180°
Quadrant IV: Add 360°
